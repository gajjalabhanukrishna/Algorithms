 * Given an input string , reverse the string word by word.

 * Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]

 *Note:
 *
 * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
 * The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 * The words are always separated by a single space.
 * Follow up: Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
